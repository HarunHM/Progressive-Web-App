A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. 
It is –
<br>
Progressive – because it lazy-loads itself.
<br>
Web – because it’s written in the languages of the Web – HTML, CSS, and, JavaScript.
<br>
App – because it installs and runs code on the mobile device.

PWA should work and compatible with all browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and all devices.
<br>
<h4>Responsive</h4>
It should be responsive so that it may fit into all screens, irrelevant to the devices (such as mobile, tab) it is being used.
<br>
<h4>Connectivity Independent</h4>
It should provide rich user-experience even on low-quality networks (such as 2G, 3G, 4G, etc.) and work offline in case there is no stable connection.
<br>
<h4>App-Like Experience</h4>
Though it is not a native app at all, it should provide an app-like experience and users should add PWA from the browsers, itself.
<br>
<h4>Safe
It should be served via HTTPS so that users would feel secure using it as they find in the native apps.

Push Notifications
It should engage users sending them push notification, containing updates and reminders.

Installable
Users should be allowed to install the website as an application, and if possible they should be prompted with the pop-up suggesting ‘Add to Homescreen.’

Linkable
It should be shared, and users or receiver should not require to install it.

Advantages of using PWA
Better user engagement resulting in better conversions
Smartphones have taken the internet by storm, and today, every company needs to focus on mobile first experience to outperform their competitors.

There are a number of case studies available on the internet that you can check showcasing how the mobile first transition increased their revenues and acquisitions.

Here are a few interesting case studies –
<p>
<b>Treebo</b> – Treebo launched their PWA, and their conversation rate increased by 4X.

<b>Tinder</b> – Tinder launched their PWA to cut the load time to 4.69 seconds from 11.91 seconds. Their PWA app is 90% smaller than their native Android app.
<br>

<b>Uber</b> – Uber launched their PWA to cut the load time on 2G networks. Their PWA app is only 50k gzipped and only takes 3 seconds to load even on a 2G network.
</p>

<h4>Cost savings<h4>
<p>There are a number of ways to build a PWA using service workers. Service workers are tools that are installed on a user device which monitor the application
to check which files need to be reloaded and which files can be cached.</p>
It is a much cheaper way of building a mobile app than building a platform-specific native mobile app.
